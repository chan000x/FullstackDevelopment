To Rebuild The project(jar) : mvn clean install

To run the all the test cases unit test and Integration test : mvn clean verify
Executethe jar : java -jar target/jarFileName.jar

All the java files those ends with *Test.java will executed in unit testing by surefire plugin.
To prevent some files from executing in that phase you need to exclude them in pom.xml file.

To Integration Test we use the failsafe plugin and it execute those Integration test cases after the
unit test is done. we have to include those file names in pom.xml.

Buildhelper pluging is used to create a different port for test cases.
it must include in those failsafe and sureplugin to create a different port in pom.xml.

so application and test cases uses different port for the excution.
